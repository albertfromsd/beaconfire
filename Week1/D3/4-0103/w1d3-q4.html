                Deep into that darkness peering,

                Long I stood there, wondering, fearing,

                Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals

                Ever dared to dream before;

                But the silence was unbroken,

                And the stillness gave no token,

                And the only word there spoken

                Was the whispered word, "Lenore!"

                This I whispered, and an echo

                Murmured back the word, "Lenore!"

                Merely this, and nothing more.

                Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,

                With conquering limbs astride from land to land;

                Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand

                A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame

                Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name

                Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand

                Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command

                The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.

                “Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she

                With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor,

                Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,

                The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.

                Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,

                I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”

                Because I could not stop for Death,

                He kindly stopped for me;

                The carriage held but just ourselves

                And Immortality.

                Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?

                Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
                
                Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
                
                And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;
                
                Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
                
                And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
                
                And every fair from fair sometime declines,
                
                By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;
                
                But thy eternal summer shall not fade,
                
                Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;
                
                Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,
                
                When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:
                
                So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
            
                So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.

                And all should cry, Beware! Beware!

                His flashing eyes, his floating hair!
                
                Weave a circle round him thrice,
                
                And close your eyes with holy dread
                
                For he on honey-dew hath fed,
                
                And drunk the milk of Paradise.

                Turning and turning in the widening gyre   

                The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
                
                Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;
                
                Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
                
                The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere   
                
                The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
                
                The best lack all conviction, while the worst   
                
                Are full of passionate intensity.
